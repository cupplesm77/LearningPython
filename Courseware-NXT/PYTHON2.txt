At this time, there are - amazingly - NO differences between
Python 2.7 and Python 3.x in the topics covered in the course.

Future updates may introduce differences, which will be noted here.

(If you notice any difference that should be pointed out, please
notify me at https://powerfulpython.com/contact/ .)
